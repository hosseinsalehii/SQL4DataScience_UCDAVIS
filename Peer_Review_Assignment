Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

Completed and Submitted by Hossein Salehi.


Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10,000
ii. Business table = 10,000
iii. Category table = 10,000
iv. Checkin table = 10,000
v. elite_years table = 10,000
vi. friend table = 10,000
vii. hours table = 10,000
viii. photo table = 10,000 
ix. review table = 10,000 
x. tip table = 10,000 
xi. user table = 10,000
	
//**SAMPLE CODE**//
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table_name


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10,000 (key: id) 
ii. Hours = 1,562 (key: business_id)
iii. Category = 2,643 (key: business_id)
iv. Attribute = 1,115 (key: business_id)
v. Review = 10,000 (key: id), 8,090 (key: business_id), 9,581 (key: user_id) 
vi. Checkin = 493 (key: business_id)
vii. Photo = 10,000 (key: id), 6,493 (key: photo)
viii. Tip = 537 (key: user_id), 3,979 (key: business_id)
ix. User = 10,000 (key: id)
x. Friend = 11 (key: user_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2,780 (key: user_id)

//**SAMPLE CODE**//
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT key_name)
FROM table_name


Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

Answer: No
	
	
SQL code used to arrive at answer:

Based the on the results above, there is no clear relationship between the number of reviews and number of fans. For instance, Amy and Yuri with the most and least fans
(respectively) are having the least and most number of reviews on the list. This shows that there might be some other explanatory factors that needs to be investigated.

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

Answer:
Yes, according to the results, there are 1780 reviews with the word "love" and only 232 reviews with the word "hate".

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
(The city of Las Vegas and the food industry are selected)
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Yes, the group with a higher star rating opens late and closes early on Saturdays.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes, the group with a lower rating stars has also less review counts (a total of 6 reviews).
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
No, there is no clear relationship between the location of the groups and their other data.


SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT
business.name, business.city, category.category, business.stars, hours.hours, business.review_count, business.address, business.postal_code
FROM (business INNER JOIN category ON business.id =
category.business_id) INNER JOIN hours ON hours.business_id =
business.id
WHERE business.city = 'Las Vegas' AND category.category = "Food"
GROUP BY business.stars;

Output:

+-----------------------------+-----------+----------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-----------------------------+-------------+
| name                        | city      | category | stars | hours                | review_count | address                     | postal_code |
+-----------------------------+-----------+----------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-----------------------------+-------------+
| Walgreens                   | Las Vegas | Food     |   2.5 | Saturday|8:00-22:00  |            6 | 3808 E Tropicana Ave        | 89121       |
| Sweet Ruby Jane Confections | Las Vegas | Food     |   4.0 | Saturday|10:00-19:00 |           30 | 8975 S Eastern Ave, Ste 3-B | 89123       |
+-----------------------------+-----------+----------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-----------------------------+-------------+

		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
On average, the group that is still open has a higher rating stars compared to the group that is not open.

ii. Difference 2:
On average, the group that is still open has a fewer number of reviews compared to the group that is not open
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT business.name, business.is_open, category.category, business.stars, hours.hours, business.review_count, business.postal_code
FROM (business inner join category on business.id = category.business_id) inner join hours on hours.business_id = category.business_id
WHERE business.city = 'Las Vegas' 
GROUP BY business.is_open;


Output:

+--------------------------+---------+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+
| name                     | is_open | category    | stars | hours                | review_count | postal_code |
+--------------------------+---------+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+
| Jacques Cafe             |       0 | Gluten-Free |   4.0 | Saturday|11:00-20:00 |          168 | 89134       |
| Desert Medical Equipment |       1 | Shopping    |   5.0 | Monday|8:00-17:00    |            4 | 89118       |
+--------------------------+---------+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+



	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
I am going to investigate whether specific type of food is more popular among the residents of the cities in the dataset.

ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
First, given different types of foods (dishes) must be selected, the average rating (stars) and the average number of comments given to each type of food must be studied based on the city that they are selected.
From the created table, it can be seen that the Korean and Japanese foods are more popular in Toronto while in Las Vegas French and Chinese dishes are having a high rating and number of reviews.

                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

+----------+----------------------+---------------+-------------------+-----------+
| category | Number_Of_Resturants |    AVG(stars) | AVG(review_count) | city      |
+----------+----------------------+---------------+-------------------+-----------+
| Korean   |                    7 |           4.5 |               8.0 | Toronto   |
| French   |                   12 |           4.0 |     135.083333333 | Las Vegas |
| Chinese  |                   13 | 3.76923076923 |     423.230769231 | Las Vegas |
| Mexican  |                   28 |         3.625 |              73.0 | Edinburgh |
| Italian  |                   13 | 3.53846153846 |     78.2307692308 | Montréal  |
| Japanese |                   20 |         3.475 |             22.85 | Toronto   |
+----------+----------------------+---------------+-------------------+-----------+
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

SELECT c.category,COUNT(b.name) AS
Number_Of_Resturants,AVG(stars),AVG(review_count),b.city
FROM (business b INNER JOIN hours h ON b.id = h.business_id)
INNER JOIN category c ON c.business_id = b.id
WHERE c.category IN
("Chinese","Mexican","French","Italian","Korean","Japanese","Ind
ian")
GROUP BY c.category
ORDER BY AVG(stars) DESC
